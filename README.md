# React Important Notes

* React's one-way data flow (also called one-way binding) keeps everything modular and fast
    * may not be immediately clear which component should own what state
* props vs state
    * `props` : props are a way of passing data from parent to child
    * `state` : state triggers changes to your underlying data model
